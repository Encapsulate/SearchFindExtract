# SearchFindExtract
Useful tool, with addon for personal use to extract certain files out of directories.

[1]: Get files by extension(*.ext) from input directory and then [COPY] or [MOVE] files to output directory.
[2]: Get path of file + filename*.ext (based on *.extension) (ROOTfolder/folder2/file.ext) save to .txt (folderRootTitle|file.*ext)

I used this for extracting GameTitle + avatarItem.bin to .txt document from an array of directories of xbox avatars.
I also used this to extract .gpd files out of a multi-subdirectory folderlist and output to 1 single directory.
